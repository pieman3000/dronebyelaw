# Snowdonia National Park 

Firstly by way of background information, [...] the majority of Snowdonia National Parkâ€™s land is held by private landowners, the National Park Authority itself has very little land in its ownership. 
It is also important to clarify that Snowdonia National Park Authority does not have any jurisdiction over the creation of byelaws, this falls to the local authority, which within the National Park is Gwynedd Council and Conwy County Borough Council.
