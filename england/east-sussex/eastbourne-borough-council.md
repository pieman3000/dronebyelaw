# Eastbourne Borough Council


## Byelaw
None

The Council did note:
> The fact that you cannot fly within 150m of crowds or areas of more than 1000 people means that town centres are out of bounds when it comes to flying drones and you can only launch/land a drone on other land with the permission of the owner.
