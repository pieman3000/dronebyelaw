# Nottingham City Council

## Byelaw
> The council must, under Section 236(8) of the Local Government Act 1972, keep a printed copy of the confirmed byelaws deposited at the officers of the authority that made them, and ‘shall at all reasonable hours be open to public inspection without payment’. Anybody wishing to view byelaws would therefore be entitled to inspect them. Unfortunately due to current restrictions around the Covid-19 pandemic the council are unable to accommodate these public inspections. 
> **We can advise, Nottingham City Council is not aware of any specific byelaws relating to the use of UAV’s on Council owned land.**

## Policies
> If you wish to use a drone in a Nottingham City Council park or public open space or want to use one as a part of a filming permit, you will need to provide a copy of the CAA credentials highlighted [PfCO] above plus the following documents:
> - A site-specific risk assessment
> - Method statement
> - Detailed site plan of landing zones and filming areas, which also details the proximity to members of the public - both individuals (staff and members of the public) and large groups
