# Chesterfield Borough Council
## Byelaw
None

## Policies
None

> Chesterfield Borough Council has at present no policy on the flying of drones in our parks. We would suggest that the flying of drones in our parks and open spaces is not to be encouraged if possible.
>
> There are occasions when for commercial reasons, filming using drones is requested. When this is the case we insist on the following:
Before any filming is permitted, details would need to be agreed, such as times of the day etc. You would also need to provide a risk assessment for the filming, a procedure (method statement) of what would happen on the day, a copy of your public liability certificate and other associated documents such as permission from the CAA and your flyer ID / OP ID.
