https://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/185993/parks-and-open-spaces-byelways-2019.pdf


> PART 6

> Interpretation of Part 6
> In this Part:
> “model aircraft” means an aircraft which weighs not more than 7 kilograms without its fuel;
> “power-driven” means driven by:
> (a) the combustion of petrol vapour or other combustible substances;
> (b) jet propulsion or by means of a rocket, other than by means of a small reaction motor powered by a solid fuel pellet not exceeding 2.54 centimetres in length; or
> (c) one or more electric motors or by compressed gas.
> “radio control” means control by a radio signal from a wireless transmitter or similar device.
>
> General prohibition
> 31. No person shall cause any power-driven model aircraft to:
> (a) take off or otherwise be released for flight or control the flight of such an aircraft; or
> (b) land in the ground without reasonable excuse;
> other than in a designated area for flying model aircraft.

## Policies
> Our website links to the 2019 Policy which is currently being made more accessible under corporate initiatives:
https://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/186309/drone-policy-and-application-form-2019.pdf
>
> This was derived around the requirements and liabilities from the ground operation of unmanned aerial vehicles from our land. The remit for flight consideration and process involved is explained clearly within this. 


## CAP722C

> Preliminary consideration of this has been made and, with the concentration upon ground management of devices within Leicester City Council regulations, rather than any attempt to manage airspace under C.A.A. compliance, it has not resulted in any departure from Leicester City’s current policies, restrictions, permission procedures or similar at this time.
