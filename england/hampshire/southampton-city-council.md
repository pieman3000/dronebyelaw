## Policies
> Drones cannot take off or land on our parks and open spaces without permission from Southampton City Council. Permission will generally only be granted where usage of a drone aids survey work and/or to undertake a professional service such as at festivals and events or filming to promote Southamptonâ€™s open spaces.

> You may fly battery operated aircraft at Lordshill Rec. However, the whole of Southampton comes under the flight path of the Airport and therefore if you intend to fly your aircraft higher than the tops of the local trees you will need to get permission from the airport.
> 
> Model flyers need to be registered with the CAA if they fly models over 250grams in weight and should carry the CAA registration identifier associated with the flyer.
>
> It is desirable to have adequate insurance against potential injury to the public.
>
> Please remember when flying model aircraft to respect other park users and follow these simple rules
>
> Do not disturb other park users with noisy motors or engines 
> Always be aware of your surroundings
> Steer clear of overhead cables 
> Keep below local tree height
> Make sure you are aware of Southampton airport flight restrictions
> Do not disturb any wildlife
> Petrol driven aircraft are not allowed in any of our green spaces.
