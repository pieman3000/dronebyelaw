# Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council


## Byelaw
None

## Policies
> There are no specific bylaws that govern model aircraft flying in Blackburn. However there is a risk assessment for the activity and the council ensure that all approved flyers are a member of the BDMAC club or hold a registration membership of the National governing body that proves they carry insurance. All club flyers apply independently to the Leisure Facilities Manager for a letter authorising them to fly on receipt of the BMFA membership card.

## CAP722C

Was CAP722C reviewed by the Council (if asked on the FOI): "Yes, the new regulations have been reviewed by managers in Leisure Services and solicitors in Legal Services. The outcome of the review will be communicated to both the club and none club members in the next fortnight."
