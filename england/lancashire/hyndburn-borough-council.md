# Hyndburn Borough Council


## Byelaw
None advised

## Policies
> Due to the inherent risks of using UAV - the only time Hyndburn Borough Council would allow UAV use would be:
> 
> 1. Health & safety reasons - visual inspection of structures at a high level to avoid people climbing to high levels or unstable structures.
> 2. Specific event safety in conjunction with the police or counter terrorism people.
> 3. To allow Lancashire Fire & Rescue to look at an ongoing fire incident to prepare properly for fire fighters to enter a site etc.
> 4. There would have to be a specific justifiable reason accompanied by a risk assessment.

## CAP722C

Was CAP722C reviewed by the Council (if asked on the FOI): No response
