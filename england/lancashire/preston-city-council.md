## Byelaw

> (ii) where any part of Grange Park has, by a notice conspicuously exhibited in such Park, been set apart by the Council for the flying of power-driven model aircraft, a person shall not fly or permit to fly any such model aircraft in any other area of such Park;
> (iii) a person shal not fly any such model aircraft unless it is attached to a control line and is kept under effective control;
> (iv) in these byelaws the expression "power-driven model aircraft" means any model aircraft driven by the combustion of petrol vapour or other combustible material.
