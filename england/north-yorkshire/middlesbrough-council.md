## Policies
> The use of such equipment in the United
Kingdom is governed by the Civil Aviation Authority [CAA] and as such, the Council would expect any operators piloting such equipment within the Borough to comply with the CAA's  standing regulations, registration requirements and licensing arrangements.  Should operators wish to take off, pilot and land their UAV equipment from Council owned land or property, they would be required to enter into an indemnity agreement that confirms both the grant of access and permission to operate the subject
equipment.  Any enquiries to pilot such equipment from Council owned land or properties should be directed to the Valuation & Estates Team in the first instance.
