# Broxbourne Borough Council


## Byelaw
>  "Pleasure Grounds Public Walks and Open Spaces" (attached) Part 6, includes a prohibition on flying model aircrafts without reasonable excuse. But there isn't a blanket ban on all
UAVs.  The Council is waiting for Secretary of State approval for a new byelaw which controls the use of drones, but this is not in force yet. 
The Council does not have a timeline for when the Secretary of State will approve the new byelaw.
