# South Norfolk District Council

## Byelaw
> I can advise that we do not allow the use of any type of aircraft on commons we are responsible for.  Attached are the relevant schemes of regulations and byelaws. None of the Byelaws specifically mentions UAVs but the byelaws were written before these came about, and we would say that UAVâ€™s are covered under this byelaw.  All commons the Council manages have the same basic byelaws.

### Mulbarton Common
### Hales Green
### Swardeston Common
> A person shall not without lawful authority, draw, drive or place upon the Common or any part thereof, [...] any aircraft [...]
