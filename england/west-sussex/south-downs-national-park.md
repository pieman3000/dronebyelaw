# South Downs National Park
>The South Downs National Park Authority doesn't own any land, with the exception of our central offices in Midhurst, to which no byelaws relating to the use of UAVs apply. Similarly, we do not have any policies which relate to the use of UAVs. 
However, we would always encourage people to speak to the Landowner of any piece of land over which they intend to fly a UAV, and a good starting point might be contacting any existing Local Authorities to ask the same question of them - Authorities such as the District or County Councils across the park.
