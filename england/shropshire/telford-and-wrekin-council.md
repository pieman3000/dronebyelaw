None

## Policies
> **UAV/Drone Statement - Events**
> Therefore it is the adopted policy of Telford & Wrekin Council not to allow any UAVâ€™s to operate within 50m metres of the outer boundary of our events (for clarity, this would mean the perimeter of the park or public space being used for the event)
> The only exception to this is where a licenced commercial UAV operator has been engaged by the Culture & Events team to film, monitor or display at the event.
> In addition, any events operating on our land, parks and open spaces, as part of our terms and conditions, will be subject to the same exclusions, unless written permission is given by the Telford & Wrekin Council Culture & Events team. This authority would only be given in exceptional circumstances and only for a licenced commercial operator.
