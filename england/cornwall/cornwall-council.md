## Policies
Environmental Services assist with licences for people to use drones for filming on Council land - https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-news-room/filming-in-cornwall/. Their response is below. 

> In order to film (including drones) on Cornwall Council land we require a completed Filming Application Form (www.cornwall.gov.uk/filming) risk assessment with information about Covid-19 and public liability insurance for £5 million. In regard to drone filming we also require documentation showing that they are certificated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and in their approval letters it states the following: 
>
> “All Drone filming will be conducted by a qualified person who has passed the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) qualification and all drone filming will take place in accordance with CAA guidelines.  The licensee shall supply to the Licensor a copy of all certification of qualification before drone filming takes place”.


## CAP722C

Was CAP722C reviewed by the Council (if asked on the FOI): "The policies will be reviewed to ensure that they are inline with current guidelines."
