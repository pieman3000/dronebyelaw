## Policies

> **On Land Owned by Exmoor National Park Authority**
Exmoor National Park Authority (ENPA) owns about 7% of the land within the National Park boundary. You can see what we own here: http://www.exmoornationalpark.gov.uk/about-us/open-data/land-and-assets
If you want to fly a drone or other model aircraft from our land you will need to explain what you would like to do and ask us for permission. Much of our estate is rented by farmers, graziers and others and so it may not always be possible for us to give you a licence; however, we will do our best to help.
If we do issue a licence it will require you to comply with the CAA’s Dronecode: https://dronesafe.uk/drone-code/
>
> Legislation relating to ownership and use of drones and model aircraft is subject to
change and if you intend to fly either in the UK it is your responsibility to be aware of
the rules currently in place.
>
> **On Other Land Within Exmoor National Park**
The Authority can’t give permission for drones to be flown from or over other people’s property, but we may be able to help with landowner information (subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation).
