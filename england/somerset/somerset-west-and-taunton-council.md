## Policies
> We have no formal written policy but if someone was looking to film we would want them to request permission from us first if it was on any of our open spaces.
> 
> We do request PLI, Risk Assessment and a Copy of the Pilot's Licence.
>
> The Council is happy to give approval as long as it is satisfied with the risk assessment and public liability insurances.
>
> It is the seekers' responsibility to risk assess the location prior to filming.  If filming on privately owned land, they would need to get the landowner’s permission.  When filming members of the public, we advise you to get the person’s consent prior to filming.
>
> If the filming will result in or have any impact on the highways or pedestrian thoroughfares, you will need to inform the Highway’s Authority

> You will be required to indemnify the appropriate Local Authorities and landowners against all losses, claims, demands, actions, proceedings, damages, costs or expenses or other liability arising as a direct result of the activities or any breach or any of the obligations in this consent to film in Taunton. 
>
> Consent also requires you not to do or permit or suffer to be done anything to injure the reputation of the location or the tenants or residents or any Authority of the location you are in; or to offend against any statute or any regulations made under any statute or any insurance effected on it.
