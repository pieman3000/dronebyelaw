## Policies
> The Council do not approve requests from private individuals to fly drones over our land. Any requests we receive from production companies such as the BBC or other professionals come through the Kent Film Office at Kent County Council who have a drone policy. They will have already checked the request and risk assessment and that it conforms within the CAA rules and  they have the correct insurance.  An officer from Dover District Council will also check that the flight plan is not in a restricted zone.
