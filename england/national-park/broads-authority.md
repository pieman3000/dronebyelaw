# Broads Authority



## Byelaw
> We do not have any specific bylaws relating to the flying of UAV’s on land
owned by the Broads Authority.


## Policies

> We do however offer general guidance on the flying of UAV’s within the Broads National Park (not just Broads Authority owned land) on our website which is linked here: [Drone Use](https://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/visiting/drone-use). This guidance and is currently being reviewed in light of the latest Civil Aviation Authority guidance and policy document. The Authority is also considering if the changes require us to adapt our own drone use. The Authority has one employee licensed to fly a drone in order to capture images for promotional and project management use.
