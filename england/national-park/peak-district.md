## Policies

> We currently don’t have a policy on the use of model aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s or drones), especially as a large area of the Peak District National Park is in private ownership. Information and advice regarding flying UAVs on open access can be found on our website using the following link: FAQs - Drones: Peak District National Park.  I have attached a copy of the Bye Laws referenced in the FAQs.  Redactions have been made to ensure that personal data (signatures and land owner details) are not disclosed.
