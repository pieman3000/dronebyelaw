# Not yet live - still under development to import data
If you're in need of information now, then each Council page has a link to the FOI request at whatdotheyknow.com 

# Welcome
Welcome to a wiki to collect details on the different Byelaws in force accepts the UK affecting drone pilots. Ths has initially been built based on Freedom of Information requests made via [What Do They Know](https://whatdotheyknow.com).

Anyone can [login](https://dronebyelaw.co.uk/login) using Discord, or Google account details. Once logged in you can comment on pages, as well as add or edit pages, and you're encouraged to do so to help ensure the information on this site is as accurate as possible.

As ever, please ensure that this resource is used as only a part of your research on deciding where you can fly. As the Operator and/or Pilot you are responsible for ensuring that your flight is legal.

## Areas for Development - User support encouraged
- London - It's complicated! Between the variety of Councils, airports and other restrictions it needs some dedicated focus.
- Adding more Civil Parishes - These are listed alphabetically in the /england/to-request folder if you'd like to 'adopt' any to send a Freedom of Information act requests and then update here. The list is from whatdotheyknow.com and so there may be some Parish Councils created since that list was updated. Don't let that stop you adding Parish Councils not already on the site!
- Scotland has not been included due to the different laws regarding trespass, more research is needed here. If you know about this, please get in touch with me at simon@dronebyelaw.co.uk
